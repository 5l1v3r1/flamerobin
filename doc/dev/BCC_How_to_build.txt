Building FlameRobin on Windows with Borland's free C++ Compiler
===============================================================

This document is a collection of quick notes about building FlameRobin on Windows with Borland's Free C++ Compiler.

Borland's Free C++ Compiler (in short BCC) is a freeware version of Borland's C++ compiler used in C++ Builder product:

http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/

I have used version 5.5.1. It should work with that or any newer version.

To build FlameRobin you have to check-out the flamerobin1 module from the projects's CVS tree, and get some tools apart from BCC:

1. IBPP library (for database access)
2. wxWidgets for GUI

IBPP is the database access layer on which FlameRobin is built, and is of course free software as well.
You need at least version 2.3.4. The the time of writing 2.3.5 is the last stable version. The best option is to download the latest sources and build.
Instructions how to build IBPP with BCC are included in IBPP CVS docs. If you need help compiling it, feel free to ask at either IBPP or FlameRobin mailing lists.

Time for the GUI subsystem. FlameRobin needs at least version 2.4.2 of wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org) and the additional STC (StyledTextControl) component. All of this is open source.
For some features, you may want to build with version 2.5.3 or above.

a) Building FlameRobin with wx2.4.2
-----------------------------------

Once all the pieces are in place, you should edit the file makefile.b32 to setup the path to IBPP library. This line is all you need to edit:
IBPP_DIR = c:\cygwin\home\home\ibpp-cvs\ibpp2\release\win32_bcc
Just point it to the right directory.

After that, run: make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1
Note: If you built wxWidgets with debug support (FINAL=0), then you should have the same option here.

b) Building FlameRobin with wx2.5.3 or above
--------------------------------------------

You need to have a valid makefile.bcc to build it. This file is generated by flamerobin.bkl with bakefile software:
http://bakefile.sourceforge.net

I you don't want to mess with bakefiles, we provide makefile.bcc in the sources. It references IBPP library and path to wxWidgets in multiple places so you can just edit it and do search&replace in several places.

The other option is to build makefile.bcc from provided bakefile: flamerobin.bkl. For this, you need to have a working bakefile installation.
After all this is setup, open the bakefile and setup the paths to wxWidgets and IBPP dirs.
Important: Make sure you read the note at start of .bkl file!

Then run:

bakefile -fborland flamerobin.bkl

Now that you got a valid makefile.bcc to the following:
makefile -f makefile.bcc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static

Note: If you build wxWidgets with debug information, then use BUILD=debug flag.


If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask at our fbmanager-devel mailing list at sourceforge.net.
