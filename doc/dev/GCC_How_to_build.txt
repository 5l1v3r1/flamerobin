Building FlameRobin on Windows with GNU C++ Compiler
====================================================

This document is a collection of quick notes about building FlameRobin on Linux with GNU C++ Compiler.

GNU C++ Compiler (in short GCC) is a open source C++ compiler of GNU project:

http://gcc.gnu.org/

Noet: Since gcc is executable name for GNU C Compiler, GNU C++ Compiler's executable is named g++ (on most system I know)

I have used versions 3.2.2 and 3.3.1. All versions from 3.2 and above are good.

To build FlameRobin you have to check-out the mghie module from the projects's CVS tree, and get some tools apart from GCC:

1. IBPP library (for database access)
2. wxWidgets for GUI

You need to check-out and compile branch rel_2_3 of IBPP. IBPP is the database access layer on which FlameRobin is built, and is of course free software as well. You can view the sources here:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ibpp/ibpp2/?only_with_tag=rel_2_3

Note that FlameRobin needs at least this version of IBPP. Instructions how to build IBPP with GCC are included in IBPP CVS docs. If you need help compiling it, feel free to ask at either IBPP or FlameRobin mailing lists.

Time for the GUI subsystem. FlameRobin needs at least version 2.4.2 of wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org) and the additional STC (StyledTextControl) component. All of this is open source.

Once all the pieces are in place, you should edit the Makefile to setup the path to IBPP library, a possibly STC library.

First line to setup (where is ibpp is checked out):
IBPP_PATH=/home/user/ibpp-cvs/release/linux

Second line to setup:
EXTRA_LIBS=/usr/lib/libwx_gtk_stc-2.4.a

Just point these to the right directories.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask at our fbmanager-devel mailing list at sourceforge.net.
