Nonetheless, we try to make sure that the information included here is accurate also for ALPHA releases.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-alphatest"></a>About the ALPHA test program</h2></div></div></div><p>Welcome to the FlameRobin Alpha test! We thank you for evaluating this software and encourage you to send comments, bug reports and feature requests back to us so we can make a better product. We remind you that this is Alpha quality software so you shouldn't expect it to work flawlessly (although we've been using it for daily work for a long time now). The main purpose of this early release is finding bugs and tune the user interface, for which we need feedback from the prospect users.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-what-fr-is"></a>What FlameRobin is</h2></div></div></div><p>FlameRobin is a GUI administration and data manipulation tool for Firebird databases. It is designed to be small, simple and cross-platform, yet offer all the basic features needed to administer Firebird servers and create/maintain databases. FlameRobin is Open Source software and binaries are currently available for Windows, several GNU/Linux and BSD flavours and MacOS X. Ports to other platforms are possible, subject to the availability of maintainers for those platforms.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-what-fr-is-not"></a>What FlameRobin is NOT</h2></div></div></div><p>Currently FlameRobin is not a full-featured administration tool, as there are plenty available for Firebird from several different parties. Our first goal with FlameRobin is to provide people not used to the command line with a GUI tool to get started with Firebird. Our longer-term goal is to develop a richer tool mainly for the Linux platform; while there are several rich and mature GUI tools under Windows, some of them available for free or for a modest price, there isn't any for Linux. Another goal of the project is for a "lite" edition of FlameRobin to be bundled with the Firebird server to serve as a starting kit for new users. This bundle may be distributed by the Firebird Project itself or by some third party.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-who-we-are"></a>Who we are</h2></div></div></div><p>The home page of the FlameRobin project is located at <a href="http://www.flamerobin.org" target="_top">http://www.flamerobin.org</a>.

In this section we talk about installing the pre-built version of FlameRobin under all currently supported platforms.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e77"></a>General information</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have installed a previous ALPHA version of FlameRobin which is <span class="emphasis"><em>less than 0.4.0</em></span>, it is recommended that you remove it before installing this version.</p><p>You won't be able to keep a config.ini file from an earlier version, because the name and file format have changed in version 0.4.0.</p><p>You might be able to keep your servers.xml file, provided that you rename it to fr_databases.conf and move it to your data folder. FlameRobin will tell you the exact path of this file (which changes with the platform) upon first startup, when it cannot find the file.</p><p>Here are the files used by FlameRobin to store configuration information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>fr_databases.conf is the list of Firebird servers and databases you work with; FlameRobin will create it (and automatically add the "localhost" server) when you run it for the first time; then you can register new servers and databases.</p></li><li><p>fr_settings.conf stores FlameRobin's configuration information, like the position and size of the main program window. You don't need to edit it by hand.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The location of these files changes with the platform, and it's usually a directory owned by the current user. FlameRobin needs write access to that folder.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e101"></a>Windows (Win32)</h3></div></div></div><p>To install FlameRobin under Windows you need the Firebird client (gds32.dll for Firebird 1.0, fbclient.dll for Firebird 1.5 and up) installed and available, then just run the automatic installer of FlameRobin which will copy all required files in a directory of your choice and optionally create desktop and start menu shortcuts.</p><p>If you need to uninstall FlameRobin you can do so from the start menu icon (unless you told the installation program not to create one) or from the Control Panel.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e108"></a>Linux</h3></div></div></div><p>Installation packages for various Linux distributions are provided on an "experimental" basis, as well as a compressed archive. Unpacking the supplied archive into a directory of your choice will do.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e113"></a>MacOS X</h3></div></div></div><p>Installation on Mac OS X is an absolute no-brainer: just drag the icon from the installation package to the folder you want the application to live in. Unpacking is handled via double clicking the downloaded file.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-getting-started"></a>Getting started</h2></div></div></div><p>Upon first startup, FlameRobin will show a "Home" tree containing only the local server (localhost), and will invite you to create new servers and databases as required. You'll also see a menu bar at the top of the window, and a search bar and status bar at the bottom. Here is a brief how-to for getting started with FlameRobin.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e123"></a>Adding a server</h3></div></div></div><p>You can add a server by right-clicking on "Home" and choosing "Register server..." (alternatively, use the "Register server..." command from the "Server" menu). You will have to specify a display name and optionally the host name and TCP port number on which the Firebird server listens. Leave the display name empty to have FlameRobin build one automatically from the host name and port values (if you don't have a host name, because yours is a local or embedded Firebird server, you will be required to type in a display name manually). Once you have added a server, you can register databases under its node.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e128"></a>Adding an existing database</h3></div></div></div><p>To access an existing database from FlameRobin you have to register it. Registration will make FlameRobin remember the database connection properties so you don't have to re-enter them every time. Locate the correct server in the tree, right click it and choose "Register existing database...". You will have to enter a display name, the database path (or alias name), the user name and password (note: the password is stored as plain text in fr_databases.conf. For security reasons, we recommend you to NOT specify it in this dialog: FlameRobin will then prompt you for the password each time you connect to the database). You can also optionally specify a connection charset and role.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e133"></a>Creating a new database</h3></div></div></div><p>To create a new, empty database, locate the desired server in the tree, right click it and choose "Create new database...". You will then need to input the database file or alias name, the user name and password for the owner of the new database (use SYSDBA as the user name and masterkey if you don't know what to put in these fields), the character set, the role, the page size (the default value of 4096 is just fine) and the SQL dialect (leave it set at 3 if you don't know what a SQL dialect is). The new database will be created and registered (which means it is available in FlameRobin).</p><p>You can also drop an existing registered database, optionally keeping the FlameRobin registration information. Use the "Drop" menu command to do that.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e140"></a>Connecting to a registered database</h3></div></div></div><p>Just double click on the database name in the tree, or right click it and choose "Connect" or "Connect as...". Choose "Disconnect" to close the connection to the database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e145"></a>Browsing metadata</h3></div></div></div><p>Upon connection, the sub-tree under the database name is populated with a description of the database structure (metadata). Browse the tree to explore the metadata. You can also use the quick search feature to locate a particular object in the tree. Just type the name of the object you are looking for (use the "*" wildcard character for a partial match) in the search box at the bottom of FlameRobin's main window and the first object in the tree whose name matches your search string will be highlighted. Now you can hit Enter to focus the tree and add the object name (or search string) to the search box's drop-down list. For your convenience, FlameRobin will remember your search strings for further use. Click the arrow buttons next to the search box to move to the next and previous matches.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e150"></a>Editing objects</h3></div></div></div><p>You can view and/or change the properties of every object you see in the tree by choosing the "Properties..." option from the object's context menu or from the "Object" menu. Please note that currently not all object types are supported, but you'll find almost all of them. Trying to show the property page for an object of an unsupported type will result in an error message. The property page is a HTML window with a summary of the object's properties and links which open other pages or specific editors. Some of the options are not yet available, but you can edit almost all aspects of the most common objects (tables, views, stored procedures, and so on). Please have a look at fr_whatsnew.html to see, well, what's new.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Although we try to test the features as much as we can, this is ALPHA software and you should only use it to work on backup copies of your databases, or perform backup copies before using FlameRobin on them. Having said that, we have to add that many users (including us) have been using FlameRobin in their everyday Firebird development for more than a year now without problems.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e158"></a>Browsing data</h3></div></div></div><p>After connecting to a database, locate a table, view or selectable stored procedure of your interest in the tree and right-click it. Choosing either "Select ... from ..." option will open the SQL editor with the table/view data shown in the grid at the bottom. In the case of selectable stored procedures with parameters, just the select statement appears in the SQL editor, so you should fill the parameter values (if you have any) and click the Execute button to see the data.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e163"></a>Running SQL statements and scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course you can use the SQL editor window to execute arbitrary SQL statements. You can open a SQL editor window by right clicking on a database node and choosing "Run a query". The SQL editor tool offers script execution capabilities (including SET AUTODDL and SET TERM support), load/save buttons, auto-completion and call-tip features, commit/rollback, some execution statistics (including but not limited to the query PLAN), and a data export tool.</p><p>To activate the data export tool, right click on the data grid. The data export tool is currently able to copy the data to the clipboard, generate SQL INSERT statements or export the data to a HTML file. All options work on the whole grid contents or just the selected parts. You can also multiple-select several different grid "islands" and have the tool export them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e170"></a>Backup and restore</h3></div></div></div><p>You can perform a database backup by right clicking on a database and choosing "Backup database...". Choose "Restore database..." to restore a backup file over the current database (you will have to disconnect first). Choose "Restore backup into new database..." (this time on the server node) to create a new database from a backup file. Note: it is usually considered bad practice to restore a backup file over an existing database. The Backup and Restore tools work in background, so you are allowed to continue working with FlameRobin while they proceed. You can work on a database while it is being backed up, but you can't work on a database while you are restoring it.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e175"></a>Advanced features</h2></div></div></div><p>This section illustrates features in FlameRobin that you won't likely use every day, but often enough to make them useful to know.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e180"></a>DDL extraction</h3></div></div></div><p>You can generate DDL (Data Definition Language) creation scripts for any object you have in the database. Just open the DDL subpage of an object's property page to see the code that creates it.</p><p>Extracting DDL scripts is useful if you want to replicate an object's structure in a different database, or create a slightly different object in the same database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e187"></a>Rebuild View functionality</h3></div></div></div><p>Firebird doesn't have an ALTER VIEW DDL command, which means that if you want to modify a view definition you need to DROP and CREATE it back. But dropping an object in Firebird requires dropping all objects that depend on it, and so on recursively. Doing this by hand is very hard, especially if the database structure is complex. A unique feature in FlameRobin, which you activate by righ-clicking a View object and selecting the "Alter..." menu command (or selecting the "Alter..." command from the "Object" menu after selecting a View), will generate a script that drops all the objects that depend on the view (in the correct order), drops and recreates the view, then recreates all the objects (again, in the correct order). The script is pasted into the SQL editor window so you can modify it and recreate everything with a single click.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e192"></a>Connected users</h3></div></div></div><p>Select "Show connected users" at the database level (or in the "Database" menu) to see a list of users connected to that database. This only works reliably with the SuperServer variant of Firebird. If you are using Firebird Classic you will see at most one user connection there, which is yours.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e197"></a>Event monitoring</h3></div></div></div><p>FlameRobin allows you to listen for Firebird events interactively. Just select the "Monitor events" command at the database level (or in the "Database" menu) to open the Event Monitor window (you will need to connect to the database first). This window allows you to monitor one or more events, save the received events to a text file and load them back. Events are posted from the database when the POST_EVENT statement is called (and the transaction is committed).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e202"></a>User management</h3></div></div></div><p>This feature is not yet implemented.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e207"></a>Retrieving server version</h3></div></div></div><p>Select "Retrieve server version" from the "Server" menu (or from a server's context menu) to see a dialog box with the server's version string. A server's version string reveals the exact build number of your Firebird server and the platform it is running on. For example, a version string equal to "WI-V1.5.2.4731 Firebird 1.5" means Firebird 1.5.2, build 4731, on Windows.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-configuration"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>This section documents the options you can set to tune FlameRobin's behaviour to your liking. You can set the options by means of the Preferences dialog, which is invoked through the "Preferences..." command in the "View" menu. The Preferences are organized in categories; here is a description of each category. Please read the tooltip that appears when you move the mouse cursor over each option to know more about it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Since new options are added to FlameRobin daily, this section of the documentation will likely be out-of-date. Please refer to the tooltips for fresh descriptions of all the available options.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e220"></a>General</h3></div></div></div><p>Here you can find options to tune the visual appearance and behaviour of FlameRobin. You can choose whether FlameRobin will remember the size and position of opened windows between sessions or not, whether FlameRobin will ask for quit confirmation or not, and other such things.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e225"></a>Center dialogs on their parent window</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to always have dialogs displayed at the center of their parent window. Otherwise dialogs are displayed at a system-defined position.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e230"></a>Remember window positions and sizes</h4></div></div></div><p>If you enable this option, FlameRobin will remember the position and size of each window you open and will open the same window at the same position and with the same time the next time. You can also choose the granularity of this option for property pages and backup/restore dialogs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Choose "Same settings for all objects" to store a single set of values; this means that whenever an Object Properties dialog is opened it will have the position and size of the last Object Properties dialog used.</p></li><li><p>Select "Same settings for all objects of same type" to store a set of values for each object type. This means that a Table Properties dialog will have different settings than a Trigger Properties dialog, but two Table Properties dialog will share the same set of values.</p></li><li><p>The third option, "Separate settings for individual objects", will make it so that every object's property page will have a set of options of its own. This mode is the most flexible, but consumes more disk space and memory.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e246"></a>Confirm quit</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to have FlameRobin ask you for quit confirmation.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e251"></a>Main Tree View</h3></div></div></div><p>Here you can tune the appearance and behaviour of FlameRobin's metadata navigation tool, the main tree.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e256"></a>Order server entries alphabetically</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to have your servers displayed in alphabetical order, otherwise they are displayed in the order they appear in servers.xml.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e261"></a>Order database entries alphabetically</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to have your databases displayed in alphabetical order, otherwise they are displayed in the order they appear in servers.xml.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e266"></a>Show columns and parameters in tree</h4></div></div></div><p>Enable this option to have table/view columns and procedure parameters displayed as tree nodes; otherwise, the tree stops at the table/view or procedure level. In case you choose to have columns and parameters displayed as tree nodes, you can also indicate whether you wish that a double click on a table/view or procedure node opens the relevant property page or expands the subtree.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e271"></a>SQL Editor</h3></div></div></div><p>Use these options to customize the behaviour of the SQL Editor, which is used in FlameRobin to execute any kind of system-generated or user-supplied query.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e276"></a>Automatically commit DDL statements</h4></div></div></div><p>Enable this option to have FlameRobin automatically "click" the Commit button on your part each time it detects a DDL (Data Definition Language) statements. DDL statements are those that modify the database structure (as opposed to DML, or Data Manipulation Language statements, which modify the data). Firebird does support transactional DDL, yet it is common practice to auto-commit these statements to avoid unexpected behaviours (for example, adding a column to an existing table and populate it through an UPDATE statement in the same transaction can lead to unexpected results with current versions of Firebird). This option sets a default state that you can change with the script commands SET AUTODDL ON and SET AUTODDL OFF.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e281"></a>When text is selected in editor</h5></div></div></div><p>Leave this option to "Execute the entire buffer" if you don't want to take advantage of FlameRobin's advanced selection handling. If you set it to "Execute only the selection" you will be able to type (or load) entire scripts in the SQL editor and only execute single parts of them by selecting them and clicking the "Execute" button. If you don't select anything, FlameRobin will execute the whole text in the editor.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e286"></a>Treat selected text as a single statement</h5></div></div></div><p>If you only ever select a single statement at a time, then you can save FlameRobin's parser some work by enabling this option. When you disable it, instead, FlameRobin will parse the selected text before executing it, break it into several statements if necessary and send them to Firebird one at a time; this is necessary since Firebird does not support executing more than one statement (i.e. a script) at a time. It can also be used if you have CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE TRIGGER (or similar) statements with SET TERM. This way, you can select and execute the CREATE statement, and you don't need SET TERM at all.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e291"></a>Clear the messages when executing new statements</h5></div></div></div><p>The SQL Editor has a message pane that shows information about each executed statement. By default this pane is cleared automatically only when you end transaction. Set this option to have FlameRobin clear it before executing a statement.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e296"></a>Enable call-tips for procedures and functions</h5></div></div></div><p>When this option is enabled, then each time you type an open round bracket after a stored procedure or UDF name in the SQL Editor, a floating tooltip (called a call-tip) will appear reminding you what the input and output parameters of the stored procedure or UDF are.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e301"></a>Show long line marker</h5></div></div></div><p>Activate this option to have the editor display a vertical line that visually marks the place where a line break would occur if lines couldn't be longer than a certain amount of characters. The marker is only a visual indicator, as FlameRobin will not enforce any limit to the length of text lines. You can also customize the column at which the marker will appear.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e306"></a>Code Completion</h5></div></div></div><p>This page contains options to customize FlameRobin's code completion feature.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="d0e311"></a>Enable automatic invocation of completion list</h6></div></div></div><p>This is the general switch to turn automatic code completion in the SQL Editor on or off. Disable it if you don't like code completion windows that pop up while you write SQL code. If you keep it enabled, then you can set a certain number of characters you'll have to type before code completion kicks in, and choose to disable code completion when a call-tip is displayed (as it would close the call-tip window).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="d0e316"></a>Manually invoke auto-complete list on</h6></div></div></div><p>Code completion may also be invoked manually.

If you don't know how quoted identifiers work in Firebird, you should leave these settings to their default values.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e431"></a>Quote names only when needed</h4></div></div></div><p>Uncheck this option to have FlameRobin always quote object names with " in dialect 3 databases. Leave it checked to let FlameRobin detect on its own when it is needed to quote identifiers. The setting "Quote names in mixed case" is only used for names entered by the user (for example, when you add a new field to a table, you type in its name).</p><p>If "Quote names only when needed" is checked and "Quote names in mixed case" is not, FlameRobin will leave the name entered by the user as it is, even if it is written in mixed case (unless the name is a reserved word or contains non-ASCII characters, in which case it is quoted).</p><p>Here are two use cases to better explain how these settings interact with each other:</p><div class="table"><a name="d0e440"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Case 1: "Quote names only when needed" = on; "Quote names in mixed case" = off</b></p><table summary="Case 1: &#34;Quote names only when needed&#34; = on; &#34;Quote names in mixed case&#34; = off" border="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"><col width="50%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>User enters</td><td>Turns into</td></tr><tr><td>FIELD1</td><td>FIELD1</td></tr><tr><td>Field1</td><td>Field1</td></tr><tr><td>Date</td><td>"Date"</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table"><a name="d0e465"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Case 2: "Quote names only when needed" = on; "Quote names in mixed case" = on</b></p><table summary="Case 2: &#34;Quote names only when needed&#34; = on; &#34;Quote names in mixed case&#34; = on" border="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"><col width="50%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>User enters</td><td>Turns into</td></tr><tr><td>FIELD1</td><td>FIELD1</td></tr><tr><td>Field1</td><td>"Field1"</td></tr><tr><td>Date</td><td>"Date"</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> The rationale behind all this is that if you write a name in mixed case, then you probably want it quoted (since you bothered to mix the case). Some users, however, find this rule awkward and unpredictable, and need a way to disable it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e491"></a>Treat quote characters like other characters</h4></div></div></div><p>This setting determines what happens if you type the quote character (") as a part of some name. Again, it only affects user-entered names. One option (unchecked) is to ignore it, other is to treat it like any other character (checked). Quotes are special cases, since they need to be escaped (by doubling them). When this setting is off, user can force quoting even when it is not required, by writing the name quoted in the text box.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e496"></a>Fields</h3></div></div></div><p>Here you can customize the appearance of field types in the tree and property windows.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e501"></a>When a column has a user-defined domain</h4></div></div></div><p>In this case you can choose to see after the column name the domain name, the data type, or both.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e506"></a>When a table column is computed</h4></div></div></div><p>For computed columns, you can choose to see after the name the data type or the computation expression, or both.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e511"></a>Logging</h3></div></div></div><p>The SQL Editor can log all executed statements to a text file (and, in a future release, to a database table).

Each statement can go into separate file, and it uses incremental numbers for filenames. You can format your own filenames by using %d as a placeholder for number. If you want numbers with fixed number of digits, like 0003 instead of 3, then use %04d as placeholder, where 4 means four digits, and 0 means that it should be padded with zeros.</p><p>There are also options to add a comment header to each logged statement, and to add SET TERM statements if required.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e528"></a>Database configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a set of options in FlameRobin that you can set on a per-database basis. You access the database configuration window by right clicking on a database and selecting the "Database preferences..." command, or selecting the same command from the "Database" menu. Like global preferences, database preferences are organized in categories; here is a description of each category. Please read the tooltip that appears when you move the mouse cursor over each option to know more about it.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e533"></a>Connection</h3></div></div></div><p>This page holds options that apply to database connection and database registration info.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e538"></a>Warn when connection charset is different from database charset</h4></div></div></div><p>In Firebird it is quite an usual situation to have a single character set for an entire database, and use that character set for connecting to the database, otherwise string transliteration won't work correctly. For this reason, FlameRobin will warn you on connection if the two charsets don't match. There are cases, though, in which you might want to connect to a database with a different character set (for example when you use different charsets for different tables or even columns, something Firebird allows), so here you can turn off the warning for that particular database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e543"></a>Store password encrypted</h4></div></div></div><p>If you don't specify the password in the Database Registration Info dialog box, then FlameRobin will ask you for it every time you connect, otherwise it will connect without asking anything. In this case, though, the password is stored in clear text inside fr_databases.conf. Use this option to apply soft cryptography to the password stored in fr_databases.conf so that it cannot be stolen by the casual user.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This option only implements "security by obscurity".

This section documents what these files contain, and where they are found. While FlameRobin is installed with usable default settings, it is possible to fine-tune the installation for special uses or multiple users. The information provided here is valuable in this regard.</p><p>FlameRobin uses the following files and folders:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>fr_settings.conf; a file containing all settings you see in the Preferences dialog box and other global settings of FlameRobin, like position and size of open windows. FlameRobin needs write access privileges to this file.</p></li><li><p>fr_databases.conf; a file containing all the servers and databases defined in FlameRobin's Home tree. FlameRobin needs write access privileges to this file.</p></li><li><p>the html-templates and conf-defs folders, which contain metadata used to render some of FlameRobin's windows, and the docs folder, containing documentation files that can be opened through FlameRobin's main menu. FlameRobin only needs read access to the files in these folders.</p></li></ul></div><p>Locations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>$frhome is FlameRobin's home path. FlameRobin will find html-templates, conf-defs and docs (which are immutable and integral part of the FlameRobin distribution) in its home path. The home path is usually the application folder (on Windows) and an otherwise fixed folder on POSIX platforms.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Defining the environment variable FR_HOME will override this path.</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Passing -h &lt;path&gt; on FlameRobin's command line will override this path and the environment variable as well.</p></div></li><li><p>$fruserhome is FlameRobin's user home path.

Otherwise, it has to be a path (without the trailing path delimiter).</p><p>FlameRobin will only ever write to files in $fruserhome. If FlameRobin is configured so that these files are shared by several users (or concurrent instances of FlameRobin), then no precaution is taken to avoid overwriting other users' changes.</p></div></div></body></html>
