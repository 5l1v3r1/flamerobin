Nonetheless, we try to make sure that the information included here is accurate also for ALPHA releases.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-alphatest"></a>About the ALPHA test program</h2></div></div></div><p>Welcome to the FlameRobin Alpha test! We thank you for evaluating this software and encourage you to send comments, bug reports and feature requests back to us so we can make a better product. We remind you that this is Alpha quality software so you shouldn't expect it to work flawlessly (although we use it for daily work already). The main purpose of this early release is finding bugs and tune the user interface, for which we need feedback from the prospect users.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-what-fr-is"></a>What FlameRobin is</h2></div></div></div><p>FlameRobin is a GUI administration and data manipulation tool for Firebird databases. It is designed to be small, simple and cross-platform, yet offer all the basic features needed to administer Firebird servers and create/maintain databases. FlameRobin is Open Source software and binaries are currently available for Windows, several GNU/Linux and BSD flavours and MacOS X. Ports to other platforms are possible, subject to the availability of maintainers for those platforms.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-what-fr-is-not"></a>What FlameRobin is NOT</h2></div></div></div><p>Currently FlameRobin is not a full-featured administration tool, as there are plenty available for Firebird from several different parties. Our first goal with FlameRobin is to provide people not used to the command line with a GUI tool to get started with Firebird. Our longer-term goal is to develop a richer tool mainly for the Linux market; while there are several rich and mature GUI tools under Windows, some of them available for free or for a modest price, there isn't any for Linux. Another goal for the "lite" edition of FlameRobin is to be bundled with the Firebird server to serve as a starting kit for new users. This bundle may be distributed by the Firebird Project itself or by some third party.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-who-we-are"></a>Who we are</h2></div></div></div><p>The home page of the FlameRobin project is located at <a href="http://www.flamerobin.org" target="_top">http://www.flamerobin.org</a>.

In this section we talk about installing the pre-built version of FlameRobin under all currently supported platforms.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e72"></a>General information</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have installed a previous ALPHA version of FlameRobin which is less than 0.4.0, it is recommended that you remove it before installing this version.</p><p>You won't be able to keep a config.ini file from an earlier version, because the name and file format have changed in version 0.4.0.</p><p>You might be able to keep your servers.xml file, provided that you rename it to fr_databases.conf and move it to your data folder. FlameRobin will tell you the exact path of this file (which changes with the platform) upon first startup, when it cannot find the file.</p><p>Here are the files used by FlameRobin to store configuration information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>fr_databases.conf is the list of Firebird servers and databases you work with; FlameRobin will create it (and automatically add the "localhost" server) when you run it for the first time; then you can register new servers and databases.</p></li><li><p>fr_settings.conf stores FlameRobin's configuration information, like the position and size of the main program window. You don't need to edit it by hand.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The location of these files changes with the platform, and it's usually a directory owned by the current user. FlameRobin needs write access to that folder.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e93"></a>Windows (Win32)</h3></div></div></div><p>To install FlameRobin under Windows you need to have the Firebird client (gds32.dll for Firebird 1.0, fbclient.dll for Firebird 1.5 and up) installed and available, then just run the automatic installer of FlameRobin which will copy all required files in a directory of your choice and optionally create desktop and start menu shortcuts.</p><p>If you need to uninstall FlameRobin you can do so from the start menu icon (unless you told the installation program not to create one) or from the Control Panel.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e100"></a>Linux</h3></div></div></div><p>Installation packages for various Linux distributions are provided, as well as a compressed archive. Unpacking the supplied archive into a directory of your choice will do.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e105"></a>MacOS X </h3></div></div></div><p>Installation on Mac OS X is an absolute no-brainer: just drag the icon from the installation package to the folder you want the application to live in. Unpacking is handled via double clicking the downloaded file.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-getting-started"></a>Getting started</h2></div></div></div><p>Upon first startup, FlameRobin will present a "Home" tree containing only the local server (localhost), and will invite you to create new servers and databases as required. Here is a brief how-to for getting started with FlameRobin.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e115"></a>Adding a server</h3></div></div></div><p>You can add a server by righ-clicking on "Home" and choosing "Register server...". You will have to specify a display name, the host name and optionally the TCP port number (default 3050) on which the Firebird server listens. Once you have added a server, you can register databases under its node.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e120"></a>Adding an existing database</h3></div></div></div><p>To access an existing database from FlameRobin you have to register it. Registration will make FlameRobin remember the database connection properties so you don't have to re-enter them every time. Locate the correct server in the tree, right click it and choose "Register existing database...". You will have to enter a display name, the database path (or alias name), the user name and password (note: the password is stored as plain text in fr_databases.conf. For security reasons, we recommend you to NOT specify it in this dialog: FlameRobin will then prompt you for the password each time you connect to the database). You can also optionally specify a connection charset and role.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e125"></a>Creating a new database</h3></div></div></div><p>To create a new, empty database, locate the desired server in the tree, right click it and choose "Create new database...". You will then need to input the database file or alias name, the user name and password for the owner of the new database (use SYSDBA as the user name and masterkey if you don't know what to put in these fields), the character set, the role, the page size (the default value of 4096 is just fine) and the SQL dialect (leave it set at 3 if you don't know what a SQL dialect is). The new database will be created and registered (which means it is available in FlameRobin).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e130"></a>Connecting to a registered database</h3></div></div></div><p>Just double click on the database name in the tree, or right click it and choose "Connect" or "Connect as...". Choose "Disconnect" to close the connection to the database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e135"></a>Browsing metadata</h3></div></div></div><p>Upon connection, the sub-tree under the database name is populated with a description of the database structure (metadata). Browse the tree to explore the metadata.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e140"></a>Editing objects</h3></div></div></div><p>You can view and/or change the properties of every object you see in the tree by choosing the "Properties..." option. Please note that currently not all object types are supported, but you'll find almost all of them. Trying to show the property page for an object of an unsupported type will result in an error message. The property page is a HTML window with a summary of the object's properties and links which open other pages or specific editors. Some of the options are not yet available, but you can f. ex. edit almost all aspects of the most common objects (tables, views, stored procedures, and so on). Please have a look at fr_whatsnew.html to see, well, what's new.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Although we try to test the features as much as we can, this is ALPHA software and you should only use it to work on backup copies of your databases, or perform backup copies before using FlameRobin on them. Having said that, we have to add that many users (including us) have been using FlameRobin in their everyday Firebird development for about a year now without problems.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e148"></a>Browsing data</h3></div></div></div><p>After connecting to a database, locate a table, view or selectable stored procedure of your interest in the tree and right-click it. Choosing either "Select ... from ..." option will open the SQL editor with the table/view data shown in the lower grid. In the case of selectable stored procedures with parameters, just the select statement appears in the SQL editor, so you should fill the parameter values (if you have any) and click the Execute button to see the data.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e153"></a>Running SQL statements and scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course you can use the SQL editor window to execute arbitrary SQL statements. You can open a SQL editor window by right clicking on a database node and choosing "Run a query". The SQL editor tool offers script execution capabilities (including SET AUTODDL and SET TERM support), load/save buttons, auto-completion and call-tip features, commit/rollback, some execution statistics (including but not limited to the query PLAN), and a data export tool: to activate it, right click on the data grid. The data export tool is currently able to copy the data to the clipboard, generate SQL INSERT statements or export the data to a HTML file. All options work on the whole grid contents or just the selected parts. You can also multiple-select several different grid "islands" and have the tool export them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e158"></a>Backup and restore </h3></div></div></div><p>You can perform a database backup by right clicking on a database and choosing "Backup database...". Choose "Restore database..." to restore a backup file over the current database (you will have to disconnect first). Choose "Restore backup into new database..." (this time on the server node) to create a new database from a backup file. Note: it is usually considered bad practice to restore a backup file over an existing database. The Backup and Restore tools work in background, so you are allowed to continue working with FlameRobin while they proceed. You can work on a database while it is being backed up, but you can't work on a database while you are restoring it.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e163"></a>Advanced features</h2></div></div></div><p>This section illustrates features in FlameRobin that you won't likely use every day, but often enough to know they exist.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e168"></a>Connected users</h3></div></div></div><p>Select "Show connected users" at the database level to see a list of users connected to that database. This only works reliably with the SuperServer variant of Firebird. If you are using Firebird Classic you will see at most one user connection there, which is yours.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e173"></a>Event monitoring</h3></div></div></div><p>FlameRobin allows you to listen for Firebird events interactively. Just select the "Monitor events" command to open the Event Monitor window. This window allows you to monitor one or more events, save the received events to a text file and load them back. Events are posted from the database when the POST_EVENT statement is used.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e178"></a>User management</h3></div></div></div><p>This feature is not yet implemented.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-configuration"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>This section documents the options you can set to tune FlameRobin's behaviour to your liking. You can set the options by means of the Preferences dialog, which is invoked through the "Preferences..." menu command in the local menu of the tree's root node. The Preferences are organized in categories; here is a description of each category. Please read the tooltip that appears when you move the mouse cursor over each option to know more about it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Since new options are added to FlameRobin daily, this section of the documentation will likely be out-of-date. Please refer to the tooltips for fresh descriptions of all the available options.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e191"></a>General</h3></div></div></div><p>Here you can find options to tune the visual appearance and behaviour of FlameRobin. You can choose whether FlameRobin will remember the size and position of opened windows between sessions or not, whether FlameRobin will ask for quit confirmation or not, and other such things.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e196"></a>Center dialogs on their parent window</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to always have dialogs displayed at the center of their parent window. Otherwise dialogs are displayed at a system-defined position.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e201"></a>Remember window positions and sizes</h4></div></div></div><p>If you enable this option, FlameRobin will remember the position and size of each window you open and will open the same window at the same position and with the same time the next time. You can also choose the granularity of this option for property pages and backup/restore dialogs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Choose "Same settings for all objects" to store a single set of values; this means that whenever an Object Properties dialog is opened it will have the position and size of the last Object Properties dialog used.</p></li><li><p>Select "Same settings for all objects of same type" to store a set of values for each object type. This means that a Table Properties dialog will have different settings than a Trigger Properties dialog, but two Table Properties dialog will share the same set of values.</p></li><li><p>The third option, "Separate settings for individual objects", will make it so that every object's property page will have a set of options of its own. This mode is the most flexible, but consumes more disk space and memory.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e217"></a>Confirm quit</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to have FlameRobin ask you for quit confirmation.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e222"></a>Main Tree View</h3></div></div></div><p>Here you can tune the appearance and behaviour of FlameRobin's metadata navigation tool, the main tree.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e227"></a>Order server entries alphabetically</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to have your servers displayed in alphabetical order, otherwise they are displayed in the order they appear in servers.xml.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e232"></a>Order database entries alphabetically</h4></div></div></div><p>Set this option to have your databases displayed in alphabetical order, otherwise they are displayed in the order they appear in servers.xml.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e237"></a>Show columns and parameters in tree</h4></div></div></div><p>Enable this option to have table/view columns and procedure parameters displayed as tree nodes; otherwise, the tree stops at the table/view or procedure level. In case you choose to have columns and parameters displayed as tree nodes, you can also indicate whether you wish that a double click on a table/view or procedure node opens the relevant property page or expands the subtree.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e242"></a>SQL Editor [OUT OF DATE - please refer to the program hints]</h3></div></div></div><p>Use these options to customize the behaviour of the SQL Editor, which is used in FlameRobin to execute any kind of system-generated or user-supplied query.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e247"></a>When text is selected in editor</h4></div></div></div><p>This options turns on and off a useful feature of the SQL Editor: you can type in or paste several SQL statements and execute just one of them by selecting it before hitting the Execute button. If for some reason you'd like to always execute the content of the whole editor buffer, then disable this option.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e252"></a>Treat selected text as a single statement</h5></div></div></div><p>If you only ever select a single statement at a time, then you can save FlameRobin's parser some work by enabling this option. When this option is disabled, FlameRobin will parse the selected text before executing it, break it into several statements if necessary and send them to Firebird one at a time; this is necessary since Firebird does not support executing more than one statement (i.e. a script) at a time. It can also be used if you have CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE TRIGGER statement with SET TERM. This way, you can select and execute the statement, and you don't need SET TERM at all.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e257"></a>Clear the messages when executing new statements</h5></div></div></div><p>The SQL Editor has a message pane that shows information about each executed statement. By default this pane is cleared automatically only when you end transaction. Set this option to have FlameRobin clear it before executing a statement.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e262"></a>Enable call-tips for procedures and functions</h5></div></div></div><p>When this option is enabled, then each time you type an open round bracket after a stored procedure or UDF name in the SQL Editor, a floating tooltip (called a call-tip) will appear reminding you what the input and output parameters of the stored procedure or UDF are.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e267"></a>SQL Code Completion</h5></div></div></div><p>This page contains options to customize FlameRobin's code completion feature.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="d0e272"></a>Enable automatic invocation of completion list</h6></div></div></div><p>This is the general switch to turn automatic code completion in the SQL Editor on or off. Disable it if you don't like code completion windows that pop up while you write SQL code. If you keep it enabled, then you can set a certain number of characters you'll have to type before code completion kicks in (default 5), and choose to disable code completion when a call-tip is displayed as it would close the call-tip.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="d0e277"></a>Manually invoke auto-complete list on</h6></div></div></div><p>Code completion may also be invoked manually.

Each statement can go into separate file, and it uses incremental numbers for filenames. You can format your own filenames by using %d as a placeholder for number. If you wish numbers with fixed number of digits, like 0003 instead of 3, then use %04d as placeholder, where 4 means four digits, and 0 means that it should be padded with zeros.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e352"></a>Database configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a set of options in FlameRobin that you can set on a per-database basis. You access the database configuration window by right clicking a database and selecting the "Database preferences..." command. Like global preferences, database preferences are organized in categories; here is a description of each category. Please read the tooltip that appears when you move the mouse cursor over each option to know more about it.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e357"></a>Connection</h3></div></div></div><p>This page holds options that influence database connection and database registration info.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e362"></a>Warn when connection charset is different from database charset</h4></div></div></div><p>In Firebird it is quite an usual situation to have a single character set for an entire database, and use that character set for connecting to the database, otherwise string transliteration won't work correctly. For this reason, FlameRobin will warn you on connection if the two charsets don't match. There are cases, though, in which you might want to connect to a database with a different character set (for example when you use different charsets for different tables or even columns, something Firebird allows), so here you can turn off the warning for that particular database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e367"></a>Store password encrypted</h4></div></div></div><p>If you don't specify the password in the Database Registration Info dialog box, then FlameRobin will ask you for it every time you connect, otherwise it will connect without asking anything. In this case, though, the password is stored in clear text inside fr_databases.conf. Use this option to apply soft cryptography to the password stored in fr_databases.conf so that it cannot be stolen by the casual user.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This option only implements "security by obscurity". If you are concerned about real security, though, we recommend that you set the access permissions on fr_databases.conf accordingly at the file system level.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e375"></a>Logging</h3></div></div></div><p>Please see the section about global logging. The options are the same here, but they apply to the current database only. There is also an option to turn off logging for a particular database only while leaving it active for all the other databases.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
