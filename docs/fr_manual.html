Nonetheless, we try to make sure that the information included here is accurate also for ALPHA releases.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-alphatest"></a>2.&nbsp;About the ALPHA test program</h2></div></div></div><p>Welcome to the FlameRobin Alpha test! We thank you for evaluating this software and encourage you to send comments, bug reports and feature requests back to us so we can make a better product. We remind you that this is Alpha quality software so you shouldn't expect it to work flawlessly (although we've been using it for daily work for a long time now). The main purpose of this early release is finding bugs and tune the user interface, for which we need feedback from the prospect users.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-what-fr-is"></a>3.&nbsp;What FlameRobin is</h2></div></div></div><p>FlameRobin is a GUI administration and data manipulation tool for Firebird databases. It is designed to be small, simple and cross-platform, yet offer all the basic features needed to administer Firebird servers and create/maintain databases. FlameRobin is Open Source software and binaries are currently available for Windows, several GNU/Linux and BSD flavours and MacOS X. Ports to other platforms are possible, subject to the availability of maintainers for those platforms.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-what-fr-is-not"></a>4.&nbsp;What FlameRobin is NOT</h2></div></div></div><p>Currently FlameRobin is not a full-featured administration tool, as there are plenty available for Firebird from several different parties. Our first goal with FlameRobin is to provide people not used to the command line with a GUI tool to get started with Firebird. Our longer-term goal is to develop a richer tool mainly for the Linux platform; while there are several rich and mature GUI tools under Windows, some of them available for free or for a modest price, there isn't any for Linux. Another goal of the project is for a "lite" edition of FlameRobin to be bundled with the Firebird server to serve as a starting kit for new users. This bundle may be distributed by the Firebird Project itself or by some third party.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-who-we-are"></a>5.&nbsp;Who we are</h2></div></div></div><p>The home page of the FlameRobin project is located at <a href="http://www.flamerobin.org" target="_top">http://www.flamerobin.org</a>.

You can find the complete license text in the file fr_license.html, or <a href="http://www.flamerobin.org/license.html" target="_top">here</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-changes"></a>7.&nbsp;What's new?</h2></div></div></div><p>Please refer to fr_whatsnew.html for a detailed history of all the changes since the previous ALPHA release.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-installation"></a>8.&nbsp;Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>If you want to build FlameRobin from sources, please find instructions on our web site or Subversion repository. In this section we talk about installing the pre-built version of FlameRobin under all currently supported platforms.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e77"></a>8.1.&nbsp;General information</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have installed a previous ALPHA version of FlameRobin which is <span class="emphasis"><em>less than 0.4.0</em></span>, it is recommended that you remove it before installing this version.</p><p>You won't be able to keep a config.ini file from an earlier version, because the name and file format have changed in version 0.4.0.</p><p>You might be able to keep your servers.xml file, provided that you rename it to fr_databases.conf and move it to your data folder. FlameRobin will tell you the exact path of this file (which changes with the platform) upon first startup, when it cannot find the file.</p><p>Here are the files used by FlameRobin to store configuration information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>fr_databases.conf is the list of Firebird servers and databases you work with; FlameRobin will create it (and automatically add the "localhost" server) when you run it for the first time; then you can register new servers and databases.</p></li><li><p>fr_settings.conf stores FlameRobin's configuration information, like the position and size of the main program window. You don't need to edit it by hand.</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The location of these files changes with the platform, and it's usually a directory owned by the current user. FlameRobin needs write access to that folder.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e101"></a>8.2.&nbsp;Windows (Win32)</h3></div></div></div><p>To install FlameRobin under Windows you need the Firebird client (gds32.dll for Firebird 1.0, fbclient.dll for Firebird 1.5 and up) installed and available, then just run the automatic installer of FlameRobin which will copy all required files in a directory of your choice and optionally create desktop and start menu shortcuts.</p><p>If you need to uninstall FlameRobin you can do so from the start menu icon (unless you told the installation program not to create one) or from the Control Panel.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e108"></a>8.3.&nbsp;Linux</h3></div></div></div><p>While some Linux distributions might provide installation packages suitable for specific versions of that distribuion, FlameRobin project provides generic compressed archives containing the executable and all needed files. There are two flavors, depending of your preferences. You can use Gtk1 version, which runs faster and has less dependencies. It is suitable for slower computers and should run out-of-the-box on most distributions. Gtk2 version uses Gtk2 toolkit, so it looks nicer on the screen and it also has Unicode support.</p><p>To install FlameRobin, just unpack the chosen .tar.bz2 archive, cd into that directory and type "make install" as root. This will install FlameRobin and all the needed files to appropriate locations. After that, any user can type "flamerobin" to run the program.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e115"></a>8.4.&nbsp;MacOS X</h3></div></div></div><p>Installation on Mac OS X is an absolute no-brainer: just drag the icon from the installation package to the folder you want the application to live in. Unpacking is handled via double clicking the downloaded file.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="frrelnotes-getting-started"></a>9.&nbsp;Getting started / basic features</h2></div></div></div><p>Upon first startup, FlameRobin will show a "Home" tree containing only the local server (localhost), and will invite you to create new servers and databases as required. You'll also see a menu bar at the top of the window, and a search bar and status bar at the bottom. Here is a brief how-to for getting started with FlameRobin.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e125"></a>9.1.&nbsp;Adding a server</h3></div></div></div><p>You can add a server by right-clicking on "Home" and choosing "Register server..." (alternatively, use the "Register server..." command from the "Server" menu). You will have to specify a display name and optionally the host name and TCP port number on which the Firebird server listens. Leave the display name empty to have FlameRobin build one automatically from the host name and port values (if you don't have a host name, because yours is a local or embedded Firebird server, you will be required to type in a display name manually). Once you have added a server, you can register databases under its node.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e130"></a>9.2.&nbsp;Adding an existing database</h3></div></div></div><p>To access an existing database from FlameRobin you have to register it. Registration will make FlameRobin remember the database connection properties so you don't have to re-enter them every time. Locate the correct server in the tree, right click it and choose "Register existing database...". You will have to enter a display name, the database path (or alias name), the user name and password (note: the password is stored as plain text in fr_databases.conf. For security reasons, we recommend you to NOT specify it in this dialog: FlameRobin will then prompt you for the password each time you connect to the database). You can also optionally specify a connection charset and role.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e135"></a>9.3.&nbsp;Creating a new database</h3></div></div></div><p>To create a new, empty database, locate the desired server in the tree, right click it and choose "Create new database...". You will then need to input the database file or alias name, the user name and password for the owner of the new database (use SYSDBA as the user name and masterkey if you don't know what to put in these fields), the character set, the role, the page size (the default value of 4096 is just fine) and the SQL dialect (leave it set at 3 if you don't know what a SQL dialect is). The new database will be created and registered (which means it is available in FlameRobin).</p><p>You can also drop an existing registered database, optionally keeping the FlameRobin registration information. Use the "Drop" menu command to do that.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e142"></a>9.4.&nbsp;Connecting to a registered database</h3></div></div></div><p>Just double click on the database name in the tree, or right click it and choose "Connect" or "Connect as...". Choose "Disconnect" to close the connection to the database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e147"></a>9.5.&nbsp;Browsing metadata</h3></div></div></div><p>Upon connection, the sub-tree under the database name is populated with a description of the database structure (metadata). Browse the tree to explore the metadata. You can also use the quick search feature to locate a particular object in the tree. Just type the name of the object you are looking for (use the "*" wildcard character for a partial match) in the search box at the bottom of FlameRobin's main window and the first object in the tree whose name matches your search string will be highlighted. Now you can hit Enter to focus the tree and add the object name (or search string) to the search box's drop-down list. For your convenience, FlameRobin will remember your search strings for further use. Click the arrow buttons next to the search box to move to the next and previous matches.</p><p>There is also an advanced metadata search feature, which is described later.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e154"></a>9.6.&nbsp;Editing objects</h3></div></div></div><p>You can view and/or change the properties of every object you see in the tree by choosing the "Properties..." option from the object's context menu or from the "Object" menu. Please note that currently not all object types are supported, but you'll find almost all of them. Trying to show the property page for an object of an unsupported type will result in an error message. The property page is a HTML window with a summary of the object's properties and links which open other pages or specific editors. Some of the options are not yet available, but you can edit almost all aspects of the most common objects (tables, views, stored procedures, and so on). Please have a look at fr_whatsnew.html to see, well, what's new.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Although we try to test the features as much as we can, this is ALPHA software and you should only use it to work on backup copies of your databases, or perform backup copies before using FlameRobin on them. Having said that, we have to add that many users (including us) have been using FlameRobin in their everyday Firebird development for more than a year now without problems.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e162"></a>9.7.&nbsp;Browsing data</h3></div></div></div><p>After connecting to a database, locate a table, view or selectable stored procedure of your interest in the tree and right-click it. Choosing either "Select ... from ..." option will open the SQL editor with the table/view data shown in the grid at the bottom. In the case of selectable stored procedures with parameters, just the select statement appears in the SQL editor, so you should fill the parameter values (if you have any) and click the Execute button to see the data.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e167"></a>9.8.&nbsp;Running SQL statements and scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course you can use the SQL editor window to execute arbitrary SQL statements. You can open a SQL editor window by right clicking on a database node and choosing "Run a query". The SQL editor tool offers script execution capabilities (including SET AUTODDL and SET TERM support), load/save buttons, auto-completion and call-tip features, commit/rollback, some execution statistics (including but not limited to the query PLAN), and a data export tool.</p><p>To activate the data export tool, right click on the data grid. The data export tool is currently able to copy the data to the clipboard, generate SQL INSERT statements or export the data to a HTML file. All options work on the whole grid contents or just the selected parts. You can also multiple-select several different grid "islands" and have the tool export them.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e174"></a>9.9.&nbsp;Backup and restore</h3></div></div></div><p>You can perform a database backup by right clicking on a database and choosing "Backup database...". Choose "Restore database..." to restore a backup file over the current database (you will have to disconnect first). Choose "Restore backup into new database..." (this time on the server node) to create a new database from a backup file. Note: it is usually considered bad practice to restore a backup file over an existing database. The Backup and Restore tools work in background, so you are allowed to continue working with FlameRobin while they proceed. You can work on a database while it is being backed up, but you can't work on a database while you are restoring it.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e179"></a>10.&nbsp;Advanced features</h2></div></div></div><p>This section illustrates features in FlameRobin that you won't likely use every day, but often enough to make them useful to know.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e184"></a>10.1.&nbsp;DDL extraction</h3></div></div></div><p>You can generate DDL (Data Definition Language) creation scripts for any object you have in the database, or even for the whole database. Just open the DDL subpage of an object's property page to see the code that creates it.</p><p>Extracting DDL scripts is useful if you want to replicate an object's structure in a different database, or create a slightly different object in the same database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e191"></a>10.2.&nbsp;Rebuild View functionality</h3></div></div></div><p>Firebird doesn't have an ALTER VIEW DDL command, which means that if you want to modify a view definition you need to DROP and CREATE it back. But dropping an object in Firebird requires dropping all objects that depend on it, and so on recursively. Doing this by hand is very hard, especially if the database structure is complex. A unique feature in FlameRobin, which you activate by righ-clicking a View object and selecting the "Alter..." menu command (or selecting the "Alter..." command from the "Object" menu after selecting a View), will generate a script that drops all the objects that depend on the view (in the correct order), drops and recreates the view, then recreates all the objects (again, in the correct order). The script is pasted into the SQL editor window so you can modify it and recreate everything with a single click.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e196"></a>10.3.&nbsp;Connected users</h3></div></div></div><p>Select "Show connected users" at the database level (or in the "Database" menu) to see a list of users connected to that database. This only works reliably with the SuperServer variant of Firebird. If you are using Firebird Classic you will see at most one user connection there, which is yours.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e201"></a>10.4.&nbsp;Event monitoring</h3></div></div></div><p>FlameRobin allows you to listen for Firebird events interactively. Just select the "Monitor events" command at the database level (or in the "Database" menu) to open the Event Monitor window (you will need to connect to the database first). This window allows you to monitor one or more events, save the received events to a text file and load them back. Events are posted from the database when the POST_EVENT statement is called (and the transaction is committed).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e206"></a>10.5.&nbsp;User management</h3></div></div></div><p>Current versions of Firebird use a central server-wide user repository. FlameRobin allows you to add, modify and delete user accounts (but it will not allow you to delete the SYSDBA predefined user) by means of the "Manage users..." option in the Server menu (or the server's context menu item, or the Object menu item with the same caption). It is Firebird's security policy that you need to be SYSDBA to use this feature.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The proper way to change the SYSDBA password on LInux is to run the changeDBAPassword.sh script in Firebird's bin directory.

On an object's property page (in the "Privileges" subpage) you can view the privleges associated with that object, and if you hover the mouse over icons, you can see who granted them in the status bar. Clicking on the "Grant and revoke privileges" link will open a dialog box that will help granting and revoke privileges to that object (which you'll find pre-selected in the dialog box) and/or other objects as well. The dialog box allows you to build a list of grant/revoke SQL statements by clicking on appropriate controls and then on the "Add To List" button. When satisfied, click the "Execute All" button to run all the statements in the SQL editor (which will also log them for future use, as with any SQL statement executed in FlameRobin, if logging is enabled).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e219"></a>10.7.&nbsp;Server and client version</h3></div></div></div><p>Select "Retrieve server version" from the "Server" menu (or from a server's context menu) to see a dialog box with the server's version string.

This means that a Table Properties dialog will have different settings than a Trigger Properties dialog, but two Table Properties dialog will share the same set of values.</p></li><li><p>The third option, "Separate settings for individual objects", will make it so that every object's property page will have a set of options of its own.

DDL statements are those that modify the database structure (as opposed to DML, or Data Manipulation Language statements, which modify the data). Firebird does support transactional DDL, yet it is common practice to auto-commit these statements to avoid unexpected behaviours (for example, adding a column to an existing table and populate it through an UPDATE statement in the same transaction can lead to unexpected results with current versions of Firebird).

Otherwise, it has to be a path (without the trailing path delimiter).</p><p>FlameRobin will only ever write to files in $fruserhome. If FlameRobin is configured so that these files are shared by several users (or concurrent instances of FlameRobin), then no precaution is taken to avoid overwriting other users' changes.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e601"></a>14.&nbsp;Advanced topics</h2></div></div></div><p>This section will document some advanced topics about how FlameRobin works.

Here's how it works in detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>all passwords (PW) are encrypted with a master password (MPW)</p></li><li><p>the MPW alone is never saved into any file, it is only known by the user</p></li><li><p>PW + MPW comprise the Cipher (which is stored in the .conf file)</p></li><li><p>whenever a PW needs to be decrypted, the user is prompted for the MPW</p></li><li><p>Cipher + MPW yield the PW</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e627"></a>14.1.1.&nbsp;Defense from "known plain-text" attack</h4></div></div></div><p>If an attacker gets hold of FlameRobin's .conf file, and he knows one of the PWs, he would be able to compute the MPW (as Cipher + PW yield the MPW). In order to prevent this, FlameRobin uses the following scheme:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the string composed by MPW + username + database connection string is used as a seed for some irreversible random number generator (RNG) like ISAAC</p></li><li><p>the PW is encrypted with the numbers produced by the RNG</p></li><li><p>since numbers are unique for each username + database connection string, and RNG is not reversible, the attacker cannot get MPW, and he also cannot decrypt any other password</p></li></ul></div><p>For more information on ISAAC see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAAC http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html</p><p></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
