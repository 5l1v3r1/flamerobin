flamerobin Build Instructions
-------------------------------
Below are build instructions for flamerobin on all supported build environments.

-------------------------------
-- MSW - Visual C++ Build Instructions
-------------------------------
There are two ways to build using Microsoft Visual C++. One is via the dsp/dsw
project files, and the other is via the makefile.vc command line makefile.

* Using the dsp/dsw projects *
Before building, you MUST set a WXDIR environment variable which points to 
your wxWidgets root directory. To do this, go to 
Start->Control Panel->System and select the "Advanced" tab. Then, click the
"Environment Variables" button and add WXDIR to the user or system env vars.

Once that is finished, double click on flamerobin\flamerobin.dsw, select
a build configuration by going to the Build menu, selecting 
"Set build configuration" and then picking a config, then build!

* Using the makefiles *
To use the makefiles, start up a command line and navigate to the
flamerobin directory. There, run the following command:

nmake -f makefile.vc <BUILD OPTIONS>

Build options can be any of the following:

WXDIR=<dir> - tells the makefile where to find the root wxWidgets directory
DEBUG=<0,1> - tells whether to build debug (0) or release (1) build
USEDLL=<0,1> - tells whether to link against wx static or dynamic libs
UNICODE=<0,1> - tells whether to link against wx ansi or unicode build       

WXDIR *must* be specified (or set as an environment variable), but the rest
default to 0 and are optional.

-------------------------------
-- Unix - Autoconf Build Instructions
-------------------------------
To build on Unix, simply open a command line, cd into the flamerobin
root directory, and execute the following commands:

mkdir debug
cd debug
../configure <--with-wx-config=/my/path/to/wx-config> --enable-debug

for a build in debug configuration, and the following commands

mkdir release
cd release
../configure <--with-wx-config=/my/path/to/wx-config> --disable-debug

for a build in release configuration.

You only need to specify wx-config if you do not have a wx-config that can
be found on the PATH, or if you want to use a wx-config other than the
default one.

Running the command

make <IBPP=/my/path/to/ibpp>

should build the flamerobin executable. You need to specify IBPP only
if you do not have this variable set in your environment. 
If you experience any problems, please check the flamerobin developer
mailing list archive, or ask a question there.
