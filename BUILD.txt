flamerobin Build Instructions
-------------------------------
Below are build instructions for flamerobin on all supported build environments.

-------------------------------
-- MSW - Visual C++ Build Instructions
-------------------------------
There are two ways to build using Microsoft Visual C++. One is via the dsp/dsw
project files, and the other is via the makefile.vc command line makefile.

* Using the dsp/dsw projects *
Before building, you MUST set a WXDIR environment variable which points to 
your wxWidgets root directory. To do this, go to 
Start->Control Panel->System and select the "Advanced" tab. Then, click the
"Environment Variables" button and add WXDIR to the user or system env vars.

Once that is finished, double click on <Project folder>\msw\flamerobin.dsw, select
a build configuration by going to the Build menu, selecting 
"Set build configuration" and then picking a config, then build!

* Using the makefiles *
To use the makefiles, start up a command line and navigate to the
<Project folder>\msw directory. There, run the following command:

nmake -f makefile.vc <BUILD OPTIONS>

Build options can be any of the following:

WXDIR=<dir> - tells the makefile where to find the root wxWidgets directory
DEBUG=<0,1> - tells whether to build debug (0) or release (1) build
USEDLL=<0,1> - tells whether to link against wx static or dynamic libs
UNICODE=<0,1> - tells whether to link against wx ansi or unicode build       

WXDIR *must* be specified (or set as an environment variable), but the rest
default to 0 and are optional.

-------------------------------
-- Unix - Autoconf Build Instructions
-------------------------------
To build on Unix, simply open a command line, cd into the <Project folder> 
root directory, and execute the following commands:

mkdir bld
cd bld
../configure <--with-wx-config=/my/path/to/wx-config>
make
make install

You only need to specify wx-config if you do not have a wx-config that can
be found on the PATH, or if you want to use a wx-config other than the
default one.

OTHER BUILD INSTRUCTIONS - TODO!
