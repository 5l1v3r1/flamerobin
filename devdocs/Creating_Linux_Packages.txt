Linux .tar.bz2 packages are made by building the executable, stripping it and
packing the directory with needed files. I usually hand-edit Makefile and
change the paths, so that user can simply type:

make install

after unpacking it.

Here are few things to remember (a simple reminder for me):

1. Change ginstall to install in Makefile

I build packages on Slackware and it detects ginstall, which isn't available
on most newer versions of other distributions. In fact, I think ginstall was
from my old Mandrake 9.0. It doesn't matter where it came from, just to remove
it.

2. Exclude TIFF library when building

FlameRobin doesn't show any tiff images anyway, and many times it conflicts
with libtiff versions of other distributions. I guess same could be done for
gif and other stuff we don't use, so I'll just build a special version of
wxWidgets, just for the purpose of FR release.

Some other libs. may also have different versions, but wxWidgets has own
version of those, so here's a configure line for wxWidgets:

./configure --disable-debug --disable-shared --enable-unicode \
--with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libtiff=builtin --with-expat=builtin \
--with-libpng=builtin --with-zlib=builtin
