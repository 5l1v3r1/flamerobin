Building FlameRobin on Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ .NET
=============================================================

Building FlameRobin with Visual C++ .NET (version 7.1) should be easy using the provided project and solution files.

To build FlameRobin you have to use the downloaded sources or to check-out the flamerobin1 module from the projects's CVS tree.  FlameRobin uses and needs the following Open Source libraries to build:

1. IBPP library (for database access)
2. wxWidgets for GUI

You will find IBPP at 

  http://www.ibpp.org 

and you can download the source package of version 2.3.4.0 (any later version should do as well) at

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9514.

Open the included solution ibpp.sln and build both the debug and release configurations.
If you need help compiling it, feel free to ask at either IBPP or FlameRobin mailing lists.

You will find wxWidgets at

  http://www.wxwidgets.org

and you can download the source package of version 2.4.2 (stable) or 2.5.3 (development, probably a better choice if you have no other projects using wxWidgets to maintain) if you follow the "Download" link in the sidebar.
If you download the wxAll* packages (all ports combined into one) please make sure that you unzip them using the -a switch to unzip.exe to convert all files to DOS line endings on-the-fly.  Visual Studio will complain if project or solution files have UNIX line endings.  Should that happen to you, just close the projects and convert the line endings by opening and saving with a text editor.
Open the included project files and build both the debug and release configurations.  Depending on the version of wxWidgets the necessary projects are:

a) for wxWidgets 2.4.2: [WX]\src\wxWindows.dsw and [WX]\contrib\src\stc\StcVC.dsw
b) for wxWidgets 2.5.3: [WX]\build\msw\wx.dsw (contains STC)

These files are for version 6 of VC++, you should convert all projects so that a solution file for version 7.1 is created.

You have to define environment variables "IBPP" and "WXWIN" for the FlameRobin project to find the necessary libraries.  Adding them to your user environment works best.  If you have 2.4.x and 2.5.x versions of wxWidgets installed on your system you could also create special command files to run devenv.exe after the WXWIN variable is set to the matching directory.  There are configurations for both versions in the solution file.


If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask at our fbmanager-devel mailing list at sourceforge.net.
