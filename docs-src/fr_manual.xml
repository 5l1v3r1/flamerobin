    <title>About this manual</title>

    <para>Currently this manual is incomplete, and it will probably stay
    incomplete until FlameRobin reaches version 1.0. Nonetheless, we try to
    make sure that the information included here is accurate also for ALPHA
    releases.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="frrelnotes-alphatest">
    <title>About the ALPHA test program</title>

    <para>Welcome to the FlameRobin Alpha test! We thank you for evaluating
    this software and encourage you to send comments, bug reports and feature
    requests back to us so we can make a better product. We remind you that
    this is Alpha quality software so you shouldn't expect it to work
    flawlessly (although we've been using it for daily work for a long time
    now). The main purpose of this early release is finding bugs and tune the
    user interface, for which we need feedback from the prospect users.</para>

  <section id="frrelnotes-what-fr-is">
    <title>What FlameRobin is</title>

    <para>FlameRobin is a GUI administration and data manipulation tool for
    Firebird databases. It is designed to be small, simple and cross-platform,
    yet offer all the basic features needed to administer Firebird servers and
    create/maintain databases. FlameRobin is Open Source software and binaries
    are currently available for Windows, several GNU/Linux and BSD flavours
    and MacOS X. Ports to other platforms are possible, subject to the
    availability of maintainers for those platforms.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="frrelnotes-what-fr-is-not">
    <title>What FlameRobin is NOT</title>

    <para>Currently FlameRobin is not a full-featured administration tool, as
    there are plenty available for Firebird from several different parties.
    Our first goal with FlameRobin is to provide people not used to the
    command line with a GUI tool to get started with Firebird. Our longer-term
    goal is to develop a richer tool mainly for the Linux platform; while
    there are several rich and mature GUI tools under Windows, some of them
    available for free or for a modest price, there isn't any for Linux.
    Another goal of the project is for a "lite" edition of FlameRobin to be
    bundled with the Firebird server to serve as a starting kit for new users.
    This bundle may be distributed by the Firebird Project itself or by some
    third party.</para>

  <section id="frrelnotes-installation">
    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>If you want to build FlameRobin from sources, please find
    instructions on our web site or CVS. In this section we talk about
    installing the pre-built version of FlameRobin under all currently
    supported platforms.</para>

    <section>
      <title>General information</title>

      <para>If you have installed a previous ALPHA version of FlameRobin which
      is <emphasis>less than 0.4.0</emphasis>, it is recommended that you
      remove it before installing this version.</para>

      <para>You won't be able to keep a config.ini file from an earlier
      version, because the name and file format have changed in version
      0.4.0.</para>

      <para>You might be able to keep your servers.xml file, provided that you
      rename it to fr_databases.conf and move it to your data folder.
      FlameRobin will tell you the exact path of this file (which changes with
      the platform) upon first startup, when it cannot find the file.</para>

      <para>Here are the files used by FlameRobin to store configuration
      information:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>fr_databases.conf is the list of Firebird servers and
          databases you work with; FlameRobin will create it (and
          automatically add the "localhost" server) when you run it for the
          first time; then you can register new servers and databases.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>fr_settings.conf stores FlameRobin's configuration
          information, like the position and size of the main program window.
          You don't need to edit it by hand.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <note>
        <para>The location of these files changes with the platform, and it's
        usually a directory owned by the current user. FlameRobin needs write
        access to that folder.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Windows (Win32)</title>

      <para>To install FlameRobin under Windows you need the Firebird client
      (gds32.dll for Firebird 1.0, fbclient.dll for Firebird 1.5 and up)
      installed and available, then just run the automatic installer of
      FlameRobin which will copy all required files in a directory of your
      choice and optionally create desktop and start menu shortcuts.</para>

      <para>If you need to uninstall FlameRobin you can do so from the start
      menu icon (unless you told the installation program not to create one)
      or from the Control Panel.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Linux</title>

      <para>Installation packages for various Linux distributions are provided
      on an "experimental" basis, as well as a compressed archive. Unpacking
      the supplied archive into a directory of your choice will do.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>MacOS X</title>

      <para>Installation on Mac OS X is an absolute no-brainer: just drag the
      icon from the installation package to the folder you want the
      application to live in. Unpacking is handled via double clicking the
      downloaded file.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="frrelnotes-getting-started">
    <title>Getting started</title>

    <para>Upon first startup, FlameRobin will show a "Home" tree containing
    only the local server (localhost), and will invite you to create new
    servers and databases as required. You'll also see a menu bar at the top
    of the window, and a search bar and status bar at the bottom. Here is a
    brief how-to for getting started with FlameRobin.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Adding a server</title>

      <para>You can add a server by right-clicking on "Home" and choosing
      "Register server..." (alternatively, use the "Register server..."
      command from the "Server" menu). You will have to specify a display name
      and optionally the host name and TCP port number on which the Firebird
      server listens. Leave the display name empty to have FlameRobin build
      one automatically from the host name and port values (if you don't have
      a host name, because yours is a local or embedded Firebird server, you
      will be required to type in a display name manually). Once you have
      added a server, you can register databases under its node.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Adding an existing database</title>

      <para>To access an existing database from FlameRobin you have to
      register it. Registration will make FlameRobin remember the database
      connection properties so you don't have to re-enter them every time.
      Locate the correct server in the tree, right click it and choose
      "Register existing database...". You will have to enter a display name,
      the database path (or alias name), the user name and password (note: the
      password is stored as plain text in fr_databases.conf. For security
      reasons, we recommend you to NOT specify it in this dialog: FlameRobin
      will then prompt you for the password each time you connect to the
      database). You can also optionally specify a connection charset and
      role.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating a new database</title>

      <para>To create a new, empty database, locate the desired server in the
      tree, right click it and choose "Create new database...". You will then
      need to input the database file or alias name, the user name and
      password for the owner of the new database (use SYSDBA as the user name
      and masterkey if you don't know what to put in these fields), the
      character set, the role, the page size (the default value of 4096 is
      just fine) and the SQL dialect (leave it set at 3 if you don't know what
      a SQL dialect is). The new database will be created and registered
      (which means it is available in FlameRobin).</para>

      <para>You can also drop an existing registered database, optionally
      keeping the FlameRobin registration information. Use the "Drop" menu
      command to do that.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Connecting to a registered database</title>

      <para>Just double click on the database name in the tree, or right click
      it and choose "Connect" or "Connect as...". Choose "Disconnect" to close
      the connection to the database.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Browsing metadata</title>

      <para>Upon connection, the sub-tree under the database name is populated
      with a description of the database structure (metadata). Browse the tree
      to explore the metadata. You can also use the quick search feature to
      locate a particular object in the tree. Just type the name of the object
      you are looking for (use the "*" wildcard character for a partial match)
      in the search box at the bottom of FlameRobin's main window and the
      first object in the tree whose name matches your search string will be
      highlighted. Now you can hit Enter to focus the tree and add the object
      name (or search string) to the search box's drop-down list. For your
      convenience, FlameRobin will remember your search strings for further
      use. Click the arrow buttons next to the search box to move to the next
      and previous matches.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Editing objects</title>

      <para>You can view and/or change the properties of every object you see
      in the tree by choosing the "Properties..." option from the object's
      context menu or from the "Object" menu. Please note that currently not
      all object types are supported, but you'll find almost all of them.
      Trying to show the property page for an object of an unsupported type
      will result in an error message. The property page is a HTML window with
      a summary of the object's properties and links which open other pages or
      specific editors. Some of the options are not yet available, but you can
      edit almost all aspects of the most common objects (tables, views,
      stored procedures, and so on). Please have a look at fr_whatsnew.html to
      see, well, what's new.<note>
          <para>Although we try to test the features as much as we can, this
          is ALPHA software and you should only use it to work on backup
          copies of your databases, or perform backup copies before using
          FlameRobin on them. Having said that, we have to add that many users
          (including us) have been using FlameRobin in their everyday Firebird
          development for more than a year now without problems.</para>
        </note></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Browsing data</title>

      <para>After connecting to a database, locate a table, view or selectable
      stored procedure of your interest in the tree and right-click it.
      Choosing either "Select ... from ..." option will open the SQL editor
      with the table/view data shown in the grid at the bottom. In the case of
      selectable stored procedures with parameters, just the select statement
      appears in the SQL editor, so you should fill the parameter values (if
      you have any) and click the Execute button to see the data.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Running SQL statements and scripts</title>

      <para>Of course you can use the SQL editor window to execute arbitrary
      SQL statements. You can open a SQL editor window by right clicking on a
      database node and choosing "Run a query". The SQL editor tool offers
      script execution capabilities (including SET AUTODDL and SET TERM
      support), load/save buttons, auto-completion and call-tip features,
      commit/rollback, some execution statistics (including but not limited to
      the query PLAN), and a data export tool.</para>

      <para>To activate the data export tool, right click on the data grid.
      The data export tool is currently able to copy the data to the
      clipboard, generate SQL INSERT statements or export the data to a HTML
      file. All options work on the whole grid contents or just the selected
      parts. You can also multiple-select several different grid "islands" and
      have the tool export them.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Backup and restore</title>

      <para>You can perform a database backup by right clicking on a database
      and choosing "Backup database...". Choose "Restore database..." to
      restore a backup file over the current database (you will have to
      disconnect first). Choose "Restore backup into new database..." (this
      time on the server node) to create a new database from a backup file.
      Note: it is usually considered bad practice to restore a backup file
      over an existing database. The Backup and Restore tools work in
      background, so you are allowed to continue working with FlameRobin while
      they proceed. You can work on a database while it is being backed up,
      but you can't work on a database while you are restoring it.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Advanced features</title>

    <para>This section illustrates features in FlameRobin that you won't
    likely use every day, but often enough to make them useful to know.</para>

    <section>
      <title>DDL extraction</title>

      <para>You can generate DDL (Data Definition Language) creation scripts
      for any object you have in the database. Just open the DDL subpage of an
      object's property page to see the code that creates it.</para>

      <para>Extracting DDL scripts is useful if you want to replicate an
      object's structure in a different database, or create a slightly
      different object in the same database.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Rebuild View functionality</title>

      <para>Firebird doesn't have an ALTER VIEW DDL command, which means that
      if you want to modify a view definition you need to DROP and CREATE it
      back. But dropping an object in Firebird requires dropping all objects
      that depend on it, and so on recursively. Doing this by hand is very
      hard, especially if the database structure is complex. A unique feature
      in FlameRobin, which you activate by righ-clicking a View object and
      selecting the "Alter..." menu command (or selecting the "Alter..."
      command from the "Object" menu after selecting a View), will generate a
      script that drops all the objects that depend on the view (in the
      correct order), drops and recreates the view, then recreates all the
      objects (again, in the correct order). The script is pasted into the SQL
      editor window so you can modify it and recreate everything with a single
      click.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Connected users</title>

      <para>Select "Show connected users" at the database level (or in the
      "Database" menu) to see a list of users connected to that database. This
      only works reliably with the SuperServer variant of Firebird. If you are
      using Firebird Classic you will see at most one user connection there,
      which is yours.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Event monitoring</title>

      <para>FlameRobin allows you to listen for Firebird events interactively.
      Just select the "Monitor events" command at the database level (or in
      the "Database" menu) to open the Event Monitor window (you will need to
      connect to the database first). This window allows you to monitor one or
      more events, save the received events to a text file and load them back.
      Events are posted from the database when the POST_EVENT statement is
      called (and the transaction is committed).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>User management</title>

      <para>This feature is not yet implemented.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Retrieving server version</title>

      <para>Select "Retrieve server version" from the "Server" menu (or from a
      server's context menu) to see a dialog box with the server's version
      string. A server's version string reveals the exact build number of your
      Firebird server and the platform it is running on. For example, a
      version string equal to "WI-V1.5.2.4731 Firebird 1.5" means Firebird
      1.5.2, build 4731, on Windows.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="frrelnotes-configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>This section documents the options you can set to tune FlameRobin's
    behaviour to your liking. You can set the options by means of the
    Preferences dialog, which is invoked through the "Preferences..." command
    in the "View" menu. The Preferences are organized in categories; here is a
    description of each category. Please read the tooltip that appears when
    you move the mouse cursor over each option to know more about it.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Since new options are added to FlameRobin daily, this section of
      the documentation will likely be out-of-date. Please refer to the
      tooltips for fresh descriptions of all the available options.</para>
    </note>

    <section>
      <title>General</title>

      <para>Here you can find options to tune the visual appearance and
      behaviour of FlameRobin. You can choose whether FlameRobin will remember
      the size and position of opened windows between sessions or not, whether
      FlameRobin will ask for quit confirmation or not, and other such
      things.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Center dialogs on their parent window</title>

        <para>Set this option to always have dialogs displayed at the center
        of their parent window. Otherwise dialogs are displayed at a
        system-defined position.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Remember window positions and sizes</title>

        <para>If you enable this option, FlameRobin will remember the position
        and size of each window you open and will open the same window at the
        same position and with the same time the next time. You can also
        choose the granularity of this option for property pages and
        backup/restore dialogs:</para>

        <para><itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Choose "Same settings for all objects" to store a single
              set of values; this means that whenever an Object Properties
              dialog is opened it will have the position and size of the last
              Object Properties dialog used.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Select "Same settings for all objects of same type" to
              store a set of values for each object type. This means that a
              Table Properties dialog will have different settings than a
              Trigger Properties dialog, but two Table Properties dialog will
              share the same set of values.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The third option, "Separate settings for individual
              objects", will make it so that every object's property page will
              have a set of options of its own. This mode is the most
              flexible, but consumes more disk space and memory.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Confirm quit</title>

        <para>Set this option to have FlameRobin ask you for quit
        confirmation.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Main Tree View</title>

      <para>Here you can tune the appearance and behaviour of FlameRobin's
      metadata navigation tool, the main tree.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Order server entries alphabetically</title>

        <para>Set this option to have your servers displayed in alphabetical
        order, otherwise they are displayed in the order they appear in
        servers.xml.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Order database entries alphabetically</title>

        <para>Set this option to have your databases displayed in alphabetical
        order, otherwise they are displayed in the order they appear in
        servers.xml.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Show columns and parameters in tree</title>

        <para>Enable this option to have table/view columns and procedure
        parameters displayed as tree nodes; otherwise, the tree stops at the
        table/view or procedure level. In case you choose to have columns and
        parameters displayed as tree nodes, you can also indicate whether you
        wish that a double click on a table/view or procedure node opens the
        relevant property page or expands the subtree.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>SQL Editor</title>

      <para>Use these options to customize the behaviour of the SQL Editor,
      which is used in FlameRobin to execute any kind of system-generated or
      user-supplied query.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Automatically commit DDL statements</title>

        <para>Enable this option to have FlameRobin automatically "click" the
        Commit button on your part each time it detects a DDL (Data Definition
        Language) statements. DDL statements are those that modify the
        database structure (as opposed to DML, or Data Manipulation Language
        statements, which modify the data). Firebird does support
        transactional DDL, yet it is common practice to auto-commit these
        statements to avoid unexpected behaviours (for example, adding a
        column to an existing table and populate it through an UPDATE
        statement in the same transaction can lead to unexpected results with
        current versions of Firebird). This option sets a default state that
        you can change with the script commands SET AUTODDL ON and SET AUTODDL
        OFF.</para>

        <section>
          <title>When text is selected in editor</title>

          <para>Leave this option to "Execute the entire buffer" if you don't
          want to take advantage of FlameRobin's advanced selection handling.
          If you set it to "Execute only the selection" you will be able to
          type (or load) entire scripts in the SQL editor and only execute
          single parts of them by selecting them and clicking the "Execute"
          button. If you don't select anything, FlameRobin will execute the
          whole text in the editor.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Treat selected text as a single statement</title>

          <para>If you only ever select a single statement at a time, then you
          can save FlameRobin's parser some work by enabling this option. When
          you disable it, instead, FlameRobin will parse the selected text
          before executing it, break it into several statements if necessary
          and send them to Firebird one at a time; this is necessary since
          Firebird does not support executing more than one statement (i.e. a
          script) at a time. It can also be used if you have CREATE PROCEDURE
          or CREATE TRIGGER (or similar) statements with SET TERM. This way,
          you can select and execute the CREATE statement, and you don't need
          SET TERM at all.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Clear the messages when executing new statements</title>

          <para>The SQL Editor has a message pane that shows information about
          each executed statement. By default this pane is cleared
          automatically only when you end transaction. Set this option to have
          FlameRobin clear it before executing a statement.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Enable call-tips for procedures and functions</title>

          <para>When this option is enabled, then each time you type an open
          round bracket after a stored procedure or UDF name in the SQL
          Editor, a floating tooltip (called a call-tip) will appear reminding
          you what the input and output parameters of the stored procedure or
          UDF are.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Show long line marker</title>

          <para>Activate this option to have the editor display a vertical
          line that visually marks the place where a line break would occur if
          lines couldn't be longer than a certain amount of characters. The
          marker is only a visual indicator, as FlameRobin will not enforce
          any limit to the length of text lines. You can also customize the
          column at which the marker will appear.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Code Completion</title>

          <para>This page contains options to customize FlameRobin's code
          completion feature.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Enable automatic invocation of completion list</title>

            <para>This is the general switch to turn automatic code completion
            in the SQL Editor on or off. Disable it if you don't like code
            completion windows that pop up while you write SQL code. If you
            keep it enabled, then you can set a certain number of characters
            you'll have to type before code completion kicks in, and choose to
            disable code completion when a call-tip is displayed (as it would
            close the call-tip window).</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Manually invoke auto-complete list on</title>

            <para>Code completion may also be invoked manually. Here you
            select how (Ctrl+Space or Tab key).</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Allow auto-completion with Enter</title>

            <para>Set this option to have the currently selected item in the
            code completion window copied to the text buffer when you hit
            Enter. Otherwise you can use Tab key for that.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Allow auto-completion inside quoted text</title>

            <para>By default, FlameRobin will disable auto-completion inside
            quoted text. If for some reason you need it, here you can enable
            it.</para>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Statement History</title>

          <para>FlameRobin can remember the statements you execute and allow
          you to retrieve and re-execute past statements. This page allows you
          to customize the feature.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Share SQL statement history</title>

            <para>You can have a single statement history list for all the
            databases you work with ("Between all databases") or a separate
            history list for each of them ("Don't share"). Additionally, you
            can make it so that all databases with the same display name
            (typically copies of the same database, or databases with the same
            structures, on different servers) share a history list.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Limit history item size</title>

            <para>By default, each history list item is allowed to grow
            without bounds. If you are concerned about the size of your
            statement history lists, you can set an upper limit in Kilobytes
            for each statement in the history list. Statements bigger than the
            specified amount will not be added to the history list. This is
            useful if you execute entire database-creation scripts
            often.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Remember unsuccessfully executed buffers</title>

            <para>By default, only statements that are executed without errors
            are added to the history list. Set this option to have FlameRobin
            remember also statements that caused errors.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Remember statements generated by FlameRobin</title>

            <para>FlameRobin translates as much visual operations as possible
            to SQL statements. Uncheck this option to prevent this kind of
            statements from being added to the history lists.</para>

      <title>Data Grid</title>

      <para>When you issue a SQL SELECT statement in the SQL Editor, then the
      Data Grid comes into play to show the results. Here you customize its
      appearance and behaviour.</para>

      <section>

      <section>
        <title>Maximize data grid after execution of SELECT statement</title>

        <para>Here you can turn off an useful feature that will enlarge the

        returns more than a specified number of rows.</para>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Object names</title>

      <para>This page offers options to customize the way FlameRobin deals
      with object names in general, and quoted identifiers in particular. If
      you don't know how quoted identifiers work in Firebird, you should leave
      these settings to their default values.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Quote names only when needed</title>

        <para>Uncheck this option to have FlameRobin always quote object names
        with " in dialect 3 databases. Leave it checked to let FlameRobin
        detect on its own when it is needed to quote identifiers. The setting
        "Quote names in mixed case" is only used for names entered by the user
        (for example, when you add a new field to a table, you type in its
        name).</para>

        <para>If "Quote names only when needed" is checked and "Quote names in
        mixed case" is not, FlameRobin will leave the name entered by the user
        as it is, even if it is written in mixed case (unless the name is a
        reserved word or contains non-ASCII characters, in which case it is
        quoted).</para>

        <para>Here are two use cases to better explain how these settings
        interact with each other:<table>
            <title>Case 1: "Quote names only when needed" = on; "Quote names
            in mixed case" = off</title>

            <tgroup cols="2">
              <tbody>
                <row>

              </tbody>
            </tgroup>
          </table><table>
            <title>Case 2: "Quote names only when needed" = on; "Quote names
            in mixed case" = on</title>

            <tgroup cols="2">

              </tbody>
            </tgroup>
          </table> The rationale behind all this is that if you write a name
        in mixed case, then you probably want it quoted (since you bothered to
        mix the case). Some users, however, find this rule awkward and
        unpredictable, and need a way to disable it.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Treat quote characters like other characters</title>

        <para>This setting determines what happens if you type the quote
        character (") as a part of some name. Again, it only affects
        user-entered names. One option (unchecked) is to ignore it, other is
        to treat it like any other character (checked). Quotes are special
        cases, since they need to be escaped (by doubling them). When this
        setting is off, user can force quoting even when it is not required,
        by writing the name quoted in the text box.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Fields</title>

      <para>Here you can customize the appearance of field types in the tree
      and property windows.</para>

      <section>
        <title>When a column has a user-defined domain</title>

        <para>In this case you can choose to see after the column name the
        domain name, the data type, or both.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>When a table column is computed</title>

        <para>For computed columns, you can choose to see after the name the
        data type or the computation expression, or both.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Logging</title>

      <para>The SQL Editor can log all executed statements to a text file
      (and, in a future release, to a database table). This gives you the
      ability to work visually and produce scripts to easily replicate
      sequences of operations on other databases. Here you set the options to
      tune this feature.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Log DML statements</title>

        <para>When logging is enabled, by default only DDL (CREATE, ALTER,
        DROP...) statements are logged. Turn this option on to enable logging
        of DML (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) statements as well.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Enable logging to file</title>

          <para>Here you choose whether you want to log statements or not,
          select the log file name(s), and choose if you want to output for
          each statement also a comment with the version of FlameRobin,
          database and user name, and execution date and time. Each statement
          can go into separate file, and it uses incremental numbers for
          filenames. You can format your own filenames by using %d as a
          placeholder for number. If you want numbers with fixed number of
          digits, like 0003 instead of 3, then use %04d as placeholder, where
          4 means four digits, and 0 means that it should be padded with
          zeros.</para>

          <para>There are also options to add a comment header to each logged
          statement, and to add SET TERM statements if required.</para>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Database configuration</title>

    <para>There is a set of options in FlameRobin that you can set on a
    per-database basis. You access the database configuration window by right
    clicking on a database and selecting the "Database preferences..."
    command, or selecting the same command from the "Database" menu. Like
    global preferences, database preferences are organized in categories; here
    is a description of each category. Please read the tooltip that appears
    when you move the mouse cursor over each option to know more about
    it.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Connection</title>

      <para>This page holds options that apply to database connection and
      database registration info.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Warn when connection charset is different from database
        charset</title>

        <para>In Firebird it is quite an usual situation to have a single
        character set for an entire database, and use that character set for
        connecting to the database, otherwise string transliteration won't
        work correctly. For this reason, FlameRobin will warn you on
        connection if the two charsets don't match. There are cases, though,
        in which you might want to connect to a database with a different
        character set (for example when you use different charsets for
        different tables or even columns, something Firebird allows), so here
        you can turn off the warning for that particular database.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Store password encrypted</title>

        <para>If you don't specify the password in the Database Registration
        Info dialog box, then FlameRobin will ask you for it every time you
        connect, otherwise it will connect without asking anything. In this
        case, though, the password is stored in clear text inside
        fr_databases.conf. Use this option to apply soft cryptography to the
        password stored in fr_databases.conf so that it cannot be stolen by
        the casual user.<note>
            <para>This option only implements "security by obscurity". If you
            are concerned about real security, though, we recommend that you
            set the access permissions on fr_databases.conf accordingly at the
            file system level.</para>
          </note></para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Logging</title>

      <para>Please see the section about global logging. The options are the
      same here, but they apply to the current database only. There is an
      additional option to turn off logging for a particular database only
      while leaving it active for all the other databases.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The FlameRobin environment</title>

    <para>FlameRobin needs, or creates, some external files. This section
    documents what these files contain, and where they are found. While
    FlameRobin is installed with usable default settings, it is possible to
    fine-tune the installation for special uses or multiple users. The
    information provided here is valuable in this regard.</para>

    <para>FlameRobin uses the following files and folders:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>fr_settings.conf; a file containing all settings you see in the
        Preferences dialog box and other global settings of FlameRobin, like
        position and size of open windows. FlameRobin needs write access
        privileges to this file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>fr_databases.conf; a file containing all the servers and
        databases defined in FlameRobin's Home tree. FlameRobin needs write
        access privileges to this file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the html-templates and conf-defs folders, which contain metadata
        used to render some of FlameRobin's windows, and the docs folder,
        containing documentation files that can be opened through FlameRobin's
        main menu. FlameRobin only needs read access to the files in these
        folders.</para>

    <para>Locations:</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>$frhome is FlameRobin's home path. FlameRobin will find
          html-templates, conf-defs and docs (which are immutable and integral
          part of the FlameRobin distribution) in its home path. The home path
          is usually the application folder (on Windows) and an otherwise
          fixed folder on POSIX platforms.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>$fruserhome is FlameRobin's user home path. FlameRobin will
          find the conf files in its user home path. This path has to be
          writable and may be common to all users on the machine or different
          for each user. The user home path defaults to the user local data
          directory, which varies with the platform.</para>

    <para>FlameRobin will only ever write to files in $fruserhome. If
    FlameRobin is configured so that these files are shared by several users
    (or concurrent instances of FlameRobin), then no precaution is taken to
